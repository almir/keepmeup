Keep Me Up

Simple widget to hold the wake lock on your device's screen so it doesn't turn off while you read, or for any other reason one can come up with.<br><br>
__IMPORTANT:__ Keeping your screen on for a long time drains your battery, so make sure you turn it off the moment it's not needed anymore.
